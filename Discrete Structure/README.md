## üî£SECI1013 Distrete Structure (Lecturer: Dr Noorfa Haszlinna binti Mustaffa)
This course introduces the principles and applications of discrete structures in computer science. The topics covered in this course include set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. By the end of the course, the ability to use set theory, relations, and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees to real-world problems, and use deterministic finite automata (finite state machines) to model electronic devices and problems will be developed.
